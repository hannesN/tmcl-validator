== Scope
   
The Topic Maps Constraint Language (TMCL, ISO 19756) is a language defined to specify constraints and schemas for topic maps. The TMCL validator validates a given topic map against a schema compatible to the current draft (2009-11-19, http://www.isotopicmaps.org/tmcl/tmcl.html). For performance reason the currenct version of the validator (1.2) does only a loose validation, i.e. ignores the global validation rule.
