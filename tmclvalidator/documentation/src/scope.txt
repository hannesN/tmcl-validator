== Scope ==
   
The Topic Maps Constraint Language (TMCL, ISO 19756) is a language defined to specify constraints and schemas for topic maps. 
The TMCL validator validates a given topic map against schemas compatible to the current draft (2009-11-19, http://www.isotopicmaps.org/tmcl/tmcl.html). 

While the TMCL Draft requires a strict validation, the current implementation of the TMCL validator only supports loose validation.
See <<_validation_behavior, 1.1>> for a more detailed description on the validator behavior.  

=== Validation behavior ===

Loose validation means that the validator ignores the global validation rule in most of the cases, i.e. constructs for which no
constraints exist are considered valid. The behavior with respect to each constraint is described in the following table.

|=============================
|constraint |description
|tmcl:abstract-constraint | Each specified type for which an instance exist is invalid.
|tmcl:subject-identifier-constraint | Topic of the specified type which number of subject identifier are out of bounds, or for which a subject identifier exist who does not match the specified regular expression, are invalid. 
|tmcl:subject-locator-constraint | Topic of the specified type which number of subject locator are out of bounds, or for which a subject locator exist who does not match the specified regular expression, are invalid.
|tmcl:item-identifier-constraint | Not implemented yet.
|tmcl:topic-name-constraint | Topics of the specified type are invalid if the number of names of the specified name-type are is out of bounds.
|tmcl:variant-name-constraint | Topics of the specified type are invalid if they have names of the specified name-type which number of variants having the specified scope are out of bounds.
|tmcl:topic-occurrence-constraint | Topics of the specified type are invalid if the number of occurrences of the specified occurrence-type are is out of bounds.
|tmcl:topic-role-constraint | Topic of the specified type are invalid of the number of roles of the specified role-type played in associations of the specified association-type are out of bounds. 
|tmcl:scope-constraint | Names, occurrences and associations of the specified type are invalid when the number of themes of the specified type are out of bounds.
|tmcl:scope-required-constraint | Names, occurrences and associations of the specified type belonging to topics of the specified topic-type are invalid if the number of themes of the specified theme instance are out of bounds.
|tmcl:reifier-constraint | Names, occurrences and associations of the specified type are invalid if the number of reifier (0 or 1) of the specified type is out of bounds.
|tmcl:topic-reifies-constraint | Topics of the specified type are invalid of the number of construct (0 or 1) which are reified by them is out of bounds.
|tmcl:association-role-constraint | Associations of the specified type are invalid of the number of roles of the specified role-type are out of bounds.
|tmcl:role-combination-constraint | Associations of the specified type are invalid if any combination of two roles exist for which no appropriate role combination constraint exist.
|tmcl:occurrence-datatype-constraint | Occurrences of the specified type are invalid of their datatype is unequal the specified datatype.
|tmcl:unique-value-constraint | Names and occurrences of the specified type are invalid if an other name or occurrence of the same type, having the same value, exist.
|tmcl:regular-expression-constraint | Names and occurrences of the specified type are invalid of their value does not match the specified regular expression.
