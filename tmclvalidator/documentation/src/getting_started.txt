== Getting started

You can check out the validator from code.google.com using the following command:
----
hg clone https://tmcl-validator.googlecode.com/hg/ tmcl-validator
----

For using the TMCL validator you have to have some dependent libraries within your search path. 
The following table shows a list of those libraries. You could also use Maven to resolve those dependencies.

[options="header"]
|=============================
|library |description |scope
|tmapi 2.0a2 |TMAPI interface |compile
|slf4j-api 1.5.8 |Java logging library |compile
|junit 4.7 |Java unit test framework |test
|TMCL loader |Loader which allows reading CTM file which uses include statements |test
|semagia-mio 0.9.5 |Semagia IO libraries |test
|semagia-mio-xtm 0.9.4 |XTM extension of Semagio IO |test
|latest ontopia build |Ontopio Topic Map Engine |test
|=============================

The TMCL loader which is used to running the tests has some addition dependencies:

.Table 3: dependencies of the TMCL Loader 
[options="header"]
|=============================
|library |description
|tmapi 2.0a2 |TMAPI interface
|tmapix-io 0.3.0 |TMAPI extension for serialisation
|tmapi 2.0a2 |TMAPI interface
|semagia-mio-ctm |CTM extension of Semagio IO 
|=============================

The TMCL loader is only used for running the tests. It simply copies the TMCL Templates 
(http://www.isotopicmaps.org/tmcl/templates.ctm) into the schema file before the reader is invoked.
This is necessary since the used CTM Reader dosn't supports includes.
