== Functionality

The main functionality is to validate a topic map against a topic map schema.

To use the validator you have to create a new instance of the TMCLValidator class and call the validate() method.
You can whether validate a single topic map which also contains the schema information or you can give the schema 
topic map as an additional parameter. In this case the topic map and the schema will be merged using the mergeIn() method of
the used topic map engine.   
The method returns a map of invalid topic map constructs together with a set of results for each construct.
A result consists of the constraint id, i.e the subject identifier of the violated TMCL constraint, and an error message. 
For each result, you can access the constraint id via getConstraintId() and the error message via getMessage().
