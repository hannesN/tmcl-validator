=== Functionality

The main functionality is to validate a topic map against a topic map schema.

_Note:_ In the current implementation of the TMCL validator merges the topic map with the schema 
to increase the performance of the validation process as well as makes it easier to implement. 
This however, will change the topic map, therefore it is not recommended to use the topic map instance 
further after an validation process.

To use the validator you have to create a new instance of the TMCLValidator class and give the constuctor an TMAPI instance 
of the topic map schema. 
Afterwards just call the validate() method give the to be validated topic map as an parameter. 
The method returns a map of invalid topic map constructs together with a set of results for each construct.
A result consists of the constraint id, i.e the subject identifier of the violated TMCL constraint, and an error message. 
For each result, you can access the constraint id via getConstraintId() and the error message via getMessage().
